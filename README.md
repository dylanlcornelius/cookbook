# Cookbook

A program for collecting recipes.

## Development

To begin local development, download and install:

```
https://github.com/dylanlcornelius/cookbook.git
cd cookbook
npm install
```

Add firebase configurations to `src/environments/environment.ts`.

Start development server:

```
npm start
```

Run linting with the following command:

```
npm run lint
```

### Running Tests

To watch for test case changes during development, run:

```
npm run watch
```

To check all test cases once, use this command:

```
npm run test
```

> A comprehensive coverage report will be compiled in `coverage/index.html` for granular line-by-line blocks when running either the `watch` or `test` command.
